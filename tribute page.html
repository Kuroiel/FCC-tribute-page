    <p id="basic-info">Emet-Selch has been priased as one of the best villans to ever grace the Final Fantasy series, on the level of Kefka. Yes, he is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyIQeObzmc8">bad guy</a> but he is presented as not that much of a villan at the beginning of the story. He is content to let the main character go around the land and advance their agenda. In a way, this also advances Emet-Selch's agenda, depending on how the main character progresses. He even actually went out of his way to help the protagonist during their adventure in the First.</p>
